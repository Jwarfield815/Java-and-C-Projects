# Projects
A few projects that I wrote while attending Summit Technology Academy.
All the projects are either Java or C++ because those are the languages I was learning at the time.

## BinaryToDecimalConverter
This was one of the first programs I wrote in Java. It's a simple program that takes a binary number as input, and converts it into decimal. It uses Scanner to get input and modulo to convert the number to base 10.

## DiceRolling
A C++ program that rolls dice. The user enters how many dice they want to roll and how many times they want to roll them. It then asks you to enter the number that you want the dice to add up to (only possible numbers are allowed to be inputted). Then the program will tell you how many times that number was rolled. This program uses Classes, random number generation, and header files.

## DrawShapes
Click the button of the shape you want to see, and the program will draw a bunch of your shape of choice in random positions and sizes. I made this program while learning JavaFX.

## OrderPlaneSeats
A simulation of ordering plane seats. Uses a 2D array to store the seats and switch-case to parse input. Controllable through the terminal.

## PaintProgram
I simple program to draw shapes with a few options for color. The main teaching point of this program was to lean java awt and java swing as alternatives to javafx for creating GUIs. Also uses some geometry in order to create the shapes that you draw.

## Restaurant
A program that lets you order various items from a restaurant menu, then gives you a receipt of the items you purchased. This program was made to teach how to get input from the user, and how to use loops and functions.

## RockPaperScissors
Rock Paper Scissors game for 2 players. Enum was the main teaching point of this program. It's used to monitor the game state and calculate a winner.

## TicTacToe
Tic-Tac-Toe game for 2 players.This program was made to teach more uses for Enum. And Enum is used to monitor the game state (player 1 won, player 2 won, game is tied).

## TypingTutor
On-screen keyboard GUI for a typing instructor. Another program to help teach java awt and java swing.
